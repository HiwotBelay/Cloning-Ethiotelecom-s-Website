## 📚 Why I Built This

I’ve always admired the design of [Ethio Telecom’s website](https://www.ethiotelecom.et/) — it’s clean, informative, and represents modern Ethiopian digital identity. I decided to clone parts of it as a personal challenge and learning project to sharpen my front-end skills and practice building UI/UX-focused websites.
